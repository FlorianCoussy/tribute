                    <h4>Early Life (1928-1945)</h4>
                    <p>Tezuka was the eldest of three children in <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyonaka,_Osaka" target="_blank"
                        title="Toyonaka, Osaka">Toyonaka City</a>, <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka_Prefecture" target="_blank"
                        title="Osaka Prefecture">Osaka</a>. His nickname was <em>gashagasha-atama</em>
                      (<em>gashagasha</em> is slang for messy, <em>atama</em> means head). Later in life, he gave his
                      mother credit for inspiring confidence and creativity through her stories. She frequently took him
                      to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takarazuka_Grand_Theater" target="_blank"
                        title="Takarazuka Grand Theatre">Takarazuka Theatre</a>, which often headlined the <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takarazuka_Revue" target="_blank"
                        title="Takarazuka Revue">Takarazuka Revue</a>, an all-female musical theater troupe. Their
                      romantic musicals aimed at a female audience, had a large influence of Tezuka's later works,
                      including his costume designs. Not only that, but the large, sparkling eyes also had an influence
                      on Tezuka's art style. He has said that he has a profound <q>spirit of nostalgia</q> for
                      Takarazuka. When Tezuka was young, his father showed him Disney films; he became obsessed with the
                      films and began to replicate them. He also became a Disney movie buff, seeing the films multiple
                      times in a row, most famously seeing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambi" target="_blank"
                        title="Bambi">Bambi</a> more than 80 times. Tezuka started to draw comics around his second year
                      of elementary school, drawing so much that his mother would have to erase pages in his notebook in
                      order to keep up with his output. Tezuka was also inspired by works by Tagawa Hosui and Umino
                      Junzo. Around his fifth year he found a bug named "<a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_beetle" target="_blank"
                        title="Ground beetle">Osamushi</a>". It so resembled his name that he adopted "Osamushi" as his
                      pen name. He continued to develop his manga skills throughout his school career. During this
                      period he created his first adept amateur works. During high school in 1944, Tezuka was drafted to
                      work for a factory, supporting the Japanese war effort during <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" target="_blank" title="World War II">World War
                        II</a>; he simultaneously continued writing manga. In 1945, Tezuka was accepted into <a

                        title="Osaka University">Osaka University</a> and began studying medicine. During this time, he
                      also began publishing his first professional works.</p>

                    <p>Tezuka came to the realization that he could use manga as a means of helping to convince people
                      to care for the world. After World War II, at age 17, he published his first piece of work: <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary_of_Ma-chan" target="_blank"
                        title="Diary of Ma-chan"><em>Diary of Ma-chan</em></a>. Tezuka began talks with fellow manga
                      artist Shichima Sakai, who had pitched Tezuka a manga based around the famous story <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Island" target="_blank"
                        title="Treasure Island"><em>Treasure Island</em></a>. Sakai promised Tezuka a publishing spot
                      from Ikuei Shuppan if he would work on the manga. Tezuka finished the manga, only loosely basing
                      it on the original work. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Takarajima" target="_blank"
                        title="Shin Takarajima"><em>Shin Takarajima</em></a> (<em>New Treasure Island</em>) was
                      published and became an overnight success which began the golden age of manga, a craze comparable
                      to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_comic_book" target="_blank"

                    <p>In 1951, Tezuka joined a group known as Tokyo Children Manga Association consisting of other
                      manga artists such as Baba Noboru, Ota Jiro, Furusawa Hideo, Fukui Eiichi, Irie Shigeru, and
                      Negishi Komichi.</p>
                    <p>With the success of <em>New Treasure Island</em>, Tezuka traveled to <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo" target="_blank" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> in search of
                      a publisher for more of his work. After visiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobunsha"
                        target="_blank" title="Kobunsha">Kobunsha</a> Tezuka was turned down. However, publisher
                      Shinseikaku agreed to purchase <em>The Strange Voyage of Dr. Tiger</em> and Domei Shuppansha would
                      purchase <em>The Mysterious Dr. Koronko</em>. Whilst continuing his study in medical school Tezuka
                      published his first masterpieces: a trilogy of science fiction epics called <a

                    <p>By 1952, Ambassador Atom proved to be only a mild success in Japan; however, one particular
                      character became extremely popular with young boys: a humanoid robot named Atom. Tezuka received
                      several letters from many young boys. Expecting success with a series based around Atom, Tezuka's
                      producer suggested that he should be given human emotions. One day while working at a hospital
                      Tezuka was punched in the face by a frustrated American G.I. This encounter gave Tezuka the idea
                      to create Atom. On February 4, 1952, <em>Tetsuwan Atom</em> began serialization in <em>Weekly
                        Shonen Magazine</em>. The character Atom and his adventures became an instant phenomenon in
                      Japan.</p>
                    <p>Due to the success of <em>Tetsuwan Atom</em>, in 1953 Tezuka published the first <a

                    <p>In 1954 Tezuka first published what he would consider his life's work, <em>Phoenix</em>, which
                      originally appeared in <em>Mushi Production Commercial Firm</em>. In 1958 Tezuka was asked by <a

                      was widely reported that Tezuka worked as a director on the file however, Tezuka himself claimed
                      to have no part in the making of the film. He was only involved in its promotion, which later
                      sparked his interest in the animation industry. The film was released as <a

                    <h4>Production career (1961-1989)</h4>
                    <p>In 1961, Tezuka entered the animation industry in Japan by founding the production company <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushi_Production" target="_blank"

                      innovating the industry with the broadcast of the animated version of <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_Boy_(1963_TV_series)" target="_blank"
                        title="Astro Boy (1963 TV series)"><em>Astro Boy</em></a> in 1963; this series would create the
                      first successful model for animation production in Japan and would also be the first Japanese
                      animation dubbed into English for an American audience. Other series were subsequently translated
                      to animation, including <em>Jungle Emperor</em>, the first Japanese animated series produced in
                      full color. Tezuka stepped down as acting director in 1968 to found a new animation studio, <a

                      late into his life. In 1973, Mushi Productions collapsed financially and the fallout would produce
                      several influential animation production studios including <a

                <p>As a child, Tezuka's arms swelled up and he became ill. He was treated and cured by a doctor, which
                  made him want to be a doctor. At a crossing point, he asked his mother whether he should look into
                  doing manga full-time or whether he should become a doctor. At the time, being a manga author was not
                  a particularly rewarding job. The answer his mother gave was: <q>You should work doing the thing you
                    like most of all.</q> Tezuka decided to devote himself to manga creation on a full-time basis. He
                  graduated from Osaka University and obtained his medical degree, but he would later use his medical
                  and scientific knowledge to enrich his sci-fi manga, such as <a

                <p>In January 1965, Tezuka received a letter from American film director <a

                  by Kubrick's invitation, Tezuka could not afford to leave his studio for a year to live in England, so
                  he had to turn it down. Although he could not work on it, he loved the film, and would play its
                  soundtrack at maximum volume in his studio to keep him awake during long nights of work.</p>

                <p>Tezuka is known for his imaginative stories and stylized Japanese adaptations of western literature
                  with reading novels and watching films that came from the West. His early works included manga
                  versions of Disney movies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambi" target="_blank"

                  characteristic for many manga artists who followed in Tezuka's footsteps. His work, like that of other
                  manga creators, was sometimes gritty and violent.</p>

                  has three floors (15069.47 ft²). In the basement there is an "Animation Workshop" in which visitors
                  can make their own animation, and a mockup of the city of Takarazuka and a replica of the table where
                  Osamu Tezuka worked.</p>
                <p>Outside of the building's entrance, there are imitations of the hands and feet of several characters
                  from Tezuka (as in a true walk of fame) and on the inside, the entry hall, a replica of <a

                  of manga and a room for the display of anime. The exhibition is divided into two parts: Osamu Tezuka
                  and the city of Takarazuka and Osamu Tezuka, the author.</p>
                <p>The second floor contains, along with several exhibitions, a manga library with five hundred works of
                  Tezuka (some foreign editions are also present), a video library, and a lounge with decor inspired by
                  <em>Kimba the White Lion</em>.
                </p>
                <p>There is also a glass sculpture that represents the planet Earth and is based on a book written by
                  Tezuka in his childhood called "Our Earth of Glass."</p>

                      in the U.S. as its main character. Eventually, Astro Boy would become Tezuka's most famous
                      creation. He created the nuclear-powered, yet peace-loving, boy robot first after being punched in
                      the face by a drunken G.I. In 1963, <em>Astro Boy</em> made its debut as the first domestically
                      produced animated program on Japanese television. The 30-minute weekly program (of which 193
                      episodes were produced) led to the first craze for anime in Japan. In America, the TV series
                      (which consisted of 104 episodes licensed from the Japanese run) was also a hit, becoming the
                      first Japanese animation to be shown on U.S. television, although the U.S. producers downplayed
                      and disguised the show's Japanese origins. Several other <em>Astro Boy</em> series have been made

                      work, dealing with man's quest for immortality, ranging from the distant past to the far future.
                      The central character is the Phoenix, the physical manifestation of the cosmos, who carries within

                      usually due to their reincarnation. The work remained unfinished at the time of Tezuka's death in
                      1989. <em>Phoenix</em> has been filmed several times, most notably as <a
